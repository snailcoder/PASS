Planning Algorithms Simulator

This is a simple simulator for robot motion planning algorithms.

By now, basic PRM(Probabilistic Roadmap Method), Gaussian Sampling and RBB(Randomized Bridge Builder) are implemented. In the future, other planner such as OBPRM(Obstacle-Based PRM), Toggle PRM and DRM(Dynamic Roadmap Method) will be put in.

The whole project has been built successfully using Visual Studio 2008. This simulator is based on OpenGL and depend on a few libraries: ColDet, GLFW and GLM. glfw3.lib and libcoldet.lib have been generated by VS2008.

Any bug report and suggestions are approciated!
